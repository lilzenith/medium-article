    <h2>Welcome to the...</h2>
    <p>There is no content here. Actually, this is content. Magritte. But this is not really content; at least, not quality content. These are words - just some words here. Not much more. More words, actually. Yes, more words. Just some, though. Some words.</p>
    <h2>This is the second header</h2>
    <p>We can now officially all create our own blogs without the assistance of paid subscriber platforms. Well, I guess we'd have to host our sites somewhere. Maybe we can learn to do that autonomously, too. Maybe it's more of a computer science thing. Wires. Cables. Buttons. Hardware. There are buttons in programming, too, obviously. Obviously.</p>
    <p>Now that I mention it, it's probably far from the physical components of a computing machine that could ultimately host a self-coded blog. More along lines of energy, power, voltage, servers. I really wouldn't know -- you're asking the wrong person.</p>
    <p>Not that I'm not the perfect person for the job. Clearly, I am. I just created a Medium copycat.</p>
    <h2>Link Debut</h2>
    <a class="link-medium" href="#">I made a link with hover effects</a>
    <p>It has a gradient background of light green to warmer green, from top to bottom. When you hover over the link, the gradient background changes to light and darker blue.</p>
